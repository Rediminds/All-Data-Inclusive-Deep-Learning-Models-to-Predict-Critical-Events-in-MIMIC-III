# Big Query to extract Chartevents Data for HADM_ID with single ICUSTAY_ID and ICU LOS > 24 hrs
# Replace 'your-project-name.database-name' with relevant project and database names from your GCP project.
# Big Query interface was used to export data in smaller chunks and save it on Google Cloud Storage
# The exported chunks were transfered from Cloud Storage to the Compute Engine (VM) manually using data transfer commands in GCP documentation
# If not using GCP kindly modify the code to use it with your database of choice.
